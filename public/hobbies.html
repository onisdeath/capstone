    <h1>My Hobbies</h1>
    <hr />
    <h2>Reading books</h2>
    <p>I especially like reading books, thinking and going to the depths of my head makes me feel great, and happy. Here's a list of my top 3 books of all time:
      <ol>
            <li>Notes From the Underground - Fyodor Dostoevsky</li>
            <li>Fahrenheit 451 - Ray Bradbury</li>
            <li>Mockingbird - Walter Tevis</li>
      </ol>
    </p>
    <h2>Cycling</h2>
    <p>As I've spent 4 years of my life in Bodrum, a beach town which a lot of people may know as a holiday destination, I love cycling near the beach, especially in the afternoon or the evenings, going to the bicycle road near the beach cycling with my best friend has been one of my favorite activities and hobbies.</p>
    <h2>Drawing</h2>
    <p>I've been drawing from a young age on and off, and it I still sometimes draw, though not as frequent due to being busier than ever before. It's extremely fun and relaxing at times though I usually worry about the quality of my art as I feel that it is not as good quality as it could be. <br/>
      Here are a few of my drawings:

    <h2>Gym</h2>
    <p>I started going to the gym this March (2023) and have been going pretty religously. I first started out after a falling out with one of my friend group. I was pretty sad and to not feel sad, I started going to the gym. I have both lost weight and gotten leaner, but I still have a long way to go to my target body.</p>
