<h2>Some of the movies that I've enjoyed watching.</h2>
<hr/>
<h3>Interstellar</h3>
<p>I had the oppurtunity of seeing it at the cinema when it first came out and I was just amazed and so baffled by the beauty of this film.</p>
<h3>Big Hero 6</h3>
<p>One of my favorite childhood movies, the characters, the story, and even though it may be controversial, the villian was executed so nicely, still makes me teary-eyed sometimes.</p>
<h3>Fast and Furious:Tokyo Drift</h3>
<p>Even though the film "kills off" one of my favorite characters in the franchise, I still adore it for the fact that it got me into JDM cars and in general cars.</p>
<h3>Anna Karenina</h3>
<p>While the movie itself is pretty different from the book, I still adore it for the actor and actress', Aaron-Taylor Johnson and Keira Knightley, performances.</p>
